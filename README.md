This beautiful app enable users to search for github open issues associated with the github users and provide a great platform for the developer to look for github open issues,work on them and contribute back to the world tech. A user can search for a  list of github open issues associated with the valid github username and also can search for a list github open issues by selecting the language like HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. 

If A user does not provide the valid github user name , a pop up will display on a screen with a error message "Error:GitHub User Not Found". When a user provide a valid github user name, user will see the list of repostories associated with the provided user name .The list of repostories are clickable and it has a username, repostory name and status of the repo . A repo with green tick sign means it has has no open issues, where as the repo with the red cross means it has number "n" of open issues. Once a user click on the the repo it will take the user to the next page. When a user does not have any open issues ,the page will have a message that user does not have any open issues ,else it will display the list of open issues associted with the provided github username . Again the open issues are clickable once the user click on the open issues, it takes user to the issue pages of the user in github.com.

Languages used in this application are HTML , CSS and JavaScript . I also have used https://fonts.googleapis.com and https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com. I have used fetch() method to fetch data from the github api using 3 different github api endpoints to get specific data and Used multiple parameters in a query string and dynamically updated an API call using HTML attributes.
